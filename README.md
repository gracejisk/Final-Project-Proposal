# Final-Project-Proposal
# GMAIL Notification Mood Lamp
I am proposing to build a lamp that will light up accordingly to whenever a gmail notification pops up. It will also light up in a specific color of the Gmail (Red).

## Summary
The photon with internet button will help connect with the IFTTT which will allow it to connect with the GMAIL. The photon that is build with the internet button will also have LEDs which will be programmed to light up only in certain color for whenever GMAIL notification lights up.
The overall purpose of this project is to help notify in silence but in an attentive way during meetings and during work time. During personal work, it will be less distractive and help the people know when they have received an email. 

## Component Parts
For the component side, there is a wire and a photon device to connect to the laptop.
Components needed:
A photon with built in LEDs,sensor, and Internet button
Wire to connect the photon to Laptop
3D designed model for shape of lamp

On the software side, I will be needing:
IFTTT to help trigger the function every time there's an email notification.

## Challenges
The challenges I may encounter is the codes that I will need in order to help the overall device function with condition.
The buildilng of the physical model will also be challenging especially with the 3D modeling and printing.

## Timeline
Week 1: Collect components and type up proposal.
Week 2: 3D model components (and print) and laser cut components.
Week 3: Test out photon with IFTTT
Week 4: Put components both software and physical components together.
Week 5: Present final model.
